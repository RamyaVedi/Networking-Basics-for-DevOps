Network: Devices (Nodes) Linked to Exchange Data via Protocols
      A network is a group of devices (like computers, servers, or phones) that communicate with each other using standardized rules called protocols (e.g., TCP, HTTP). These devices are connected via physical or wireless means (like cables or Wi-Fi) to share data, resources, or services.

**Nodes**: Any device on the network (your laptop, a cloud server, a router).
**Data Exchange**: Sending files, streaming videos, or pinging a server.
**Protocols**: Standardized instructions, e.g., TCP ensures reliable delivery, HTTP defines web requests.

**Task**:Test a network connection: ping google.com -c 4 (sends 4 messages to Google’s server).
Look for “4 packets transmitted, 4 received” (success) and “time=X ms” (speed).
If it fails, try ping 8.8.8.8 (Google’s IP directly).
